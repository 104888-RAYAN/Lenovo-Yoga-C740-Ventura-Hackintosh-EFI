# Lenovo-Yoga-C740-14IML-Ventura-Hackintosh-EFI
Hello, I made a EFI on my Lenovo Yoga C740 14IML and decided I wanted to share it. Most things work but not everything. The apple eco-system works except Airdrop as my WiFi card isn't supported, however, this can be solved using a Broadcom WiFi card supported which is supported by Apple.

# :warning: YOU MUST SET YOUR OWN SMBIOS IN EFI>OC>CONFIG.PLIST FOR iMESSAGE AND FACETIME TO WORK! (look up a youtube video)
